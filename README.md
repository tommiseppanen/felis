Felis - Simple todo app
====================================

This is a single page application I have been developing to study ClojureScript and Reagent.

##How to run
Felis is based on [reagent-template](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent-template) so you 
can just use "lein figwheel" command to start the development server and REPL.

##Controls
This application is designed to be used with keyboard. Here are the basic controls:
- Arrow up/down: navigate items
- Ctrl + shift + arrow up/down: move item
- Ctrl + alt + arrow left/right: navigate between parent & child groups
- Ctrl + enter: mark item as done
- Ctrl + y: delete item
- Esc: cancel editing

##Todo
- Storing of the data
- Support for mouse navigation
